Q1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It setups up the meta-data structures to track changes to the files in the respository.

Q2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only has the files that have changed and are ready for commiting. The value it offers is that it reduces the amount of files that need to be synced.
