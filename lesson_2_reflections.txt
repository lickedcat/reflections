Q1 What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

It setups up the meta-data structures to track 
changes to the files in the respository.

Q2 How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only has the files that have 
changed and are ready for commiting. 
The value it offers is that it reduces the 
amount of files that need to be synced.

Q3 How can you use the staging area to make sure 
you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area can be used to visually see which 
files have been changed and from that we can 
logically group the changed files into their 
logical separate commits

Q4 What are some situations when branches would be 
helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

A situation where branches would be helpful is if you 
had code with certain information in it, but then your 
boss wanted to present it to different audiences and 
the only thing you had to change is the title for each 
new audience but you didn't want to create a new file 
and rename it for each presentation, branchign would 
have been helpful.

Q5 How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch 
structure?

Diagrams help by visualizing the different branches 
and the child - parent relationship.
